#Tetris ###By Raqtan Hoq and Allen Nguyen

Full code for two player tetris game on LED Matrices.

Two Player Battle Tetris with three different powerups and a counter to determine score.
This is implemented around the use of LED Matrices and designing our own circuits. 

Powerup 1: Clearing seven rows consecutively sends blocks to the other player, making the board cluttered.

Powerup 2: Clearing four rows consecutively clears the player's entire screen to ensure survivability.

Powerup 3: Clearing four rows at once disables the enemy player's controls.

The game ends once one player reaches the top of the stack.
